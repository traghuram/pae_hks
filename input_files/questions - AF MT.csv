3,,,Agree or disagree with (shared responsibilities) message,QA_1_w2,Yes,No,,,,,mean,Mean Score,"Being patriotic is about more than the flag and the national anthem--it’s about our commitment to each other. Some choose to make exceptional sacrifices through military service, but all of us have a responsibility to follow politics and vote, to learn about our history--both the good and the bad, and to respect others’ cultures and beliefs."
3,,,Agree or disagree with (shared experience race conservative) message,QA_2_w2,Yes,No,,,,,mean,Mean Score,"In today’s America, everyone has the opportunity to gain an education, to be treated fairly, and to succeed if they work hard—no matter their race. Poverty and prison are the consequences of poor decisions, not of skin color. While experiences of racism were a significant problem in our past, they simply are not today."
3,,,Agree or disagree with (shared experience race - democrat) message,QA_3_w2,Yes,No,,,,,mean,Mean Score,"America promises equality and opportunity for all but is not delivering on those promises. Being Black is an experience of feeling that you do not belong, of being afraid of the police, and of facing prejudice. This systemic racism is a threat to the very idea of America and we have to address this fully if we are to truly call ourselves the land of the free."
3,,,Agree or disagree with (shared experience race - balanced) message,QA_4_w2,Yes,No,,,,,mean,Mean Score,White Americans today are not directly responsible for the racism of the past. Yet many Black Americans and other minorities still suffer from the consequences of that racism and from ongoing racial injustice. Fulfilling America’s founding promise of equality means addressing this harm while also tackling the problems that face Americans of every color.
3,,,Agree or disagree with (trusted institutions) message,QA_5_w2,Yes,No,,,,,mean,Mean Score,"We cannot prosper if we do not agree on basic facts. Collapsing trust in the media, universities, and experts should be worrying to everyone. These organizations need to work harder to show objectivity and humility, and avoid telling us what to believe. Meanwhile, each of us has a duty to listen and follow the evidence."
3,,,Agree or disagree with (perceptions of the country conservative) message,QA_6_w2,Yes,No,,,,,mean,Mean Score,"America was founded as a beacon of individual liberty and freedom. We should honor our country’s founders and respect those who gave their lives to protect it. We should show our gratitude for being able to live here by honoring the American flag, standing for the national anthem, and celebrating Thanksgiving and the Fourth of July."
3,,,Agree or disagree with (perceptions of the country progressive) message,QA_7_w2,Yes,No,,,,,mean,Mean Score,"This country was founded on slavery, greed and the genocide of Native peoples. However, America also has a strong tradition of protesting against injustice. Time and again American activists have fought to extend the reach of freedom. The best way to be American is to stand up against power and prejudice and fight for the advancement of marginalized groups and those less privileged than ourselves.    "
3,,,Agree or disagree with (perceptions of the country balanced) message,QA_8_w2,Yes,No,,,,,mean,Mean Score,"Throughout our history, Americans have made incredible contributions and ugly errors. We don’t need to be ashamed to be American, but we do have a responsibility to learn from our past and fix our mistakes. And as Americans we can be proud of what we do well: advancing freedom and opportunity, welcoming immigrants from around the world, and leading in technology and innovation."
3,,,Agree or disagree with (historical record progressive) message,QA_9_w2,Yes,No,,,,,mean,Mean Score,"Throughout its history, being American has meant being white, male and Christian. Americans who are women, Black, indigenous, Latino, Asian, Jewish, Muslim, gay, lesbian, transgender, or who belong to other minority groups have felt disrespected and excluded. Today we need to intentionally make more space for people from these groups to hold leadership positions and reverse the damage done to their communities. "
3,,,Agree or disagree with (historical record balanced A) message,QA_10_w2,Yes,No,,,,,mean,Mean Score,"America is exceptional because of the ideals it was built on: freedom, opportunity, and equality. Over our history, we have often failed to live up to these ideals. We can’t change the past, but we can change the future by focusing on achieving these ideals and ensuring that everyone enjoys freedom, opportunity, and respect."
3,,,Agree or disagree with (historical record balanced B) message,QA_11_w2,Yes,No,,,,,mean,Mean Score,"America is exceptional because of the ideals it was built on: freedom, opportunity, and equality. But just believing in these ideals is not enough to achieve them. Americans need to treat each other with dignity and respect, regardless of their race, their religious beliefs, or who they voted for. When Americans are not made to feel ashamed of who they are or what they believe, our nation gets closer to achieving those founding ideals."
3,,,Agree or disagree with (historical record conservative) message,QA_12_w2,Yes,No,,,,,mean,Mean Score,"Respect isn't something you are owed, it's something you earn. In America, we don't worry or think about your skin color, your religion, or where you came from. America is unique because it provides a life of dignity to anyone of strong character, who works hard for their family and follows the law."
3,,,Agree or disagree with (responsibility and potentialism) message,QA_13_w2,Yes,No,,,,,mean,Mean Score,"America should be built on a deal of rights and responsibilities. The country should guarantee its citizens what they need to live up to their full potential: education, opportunity, and dignity. People in turn have a responsibility to use that potential to improve themselves and give back to their country and their community."
